# MEAN STACK PROJECT

Development Technology Stack to be used: Angular, SAP PI/PO, SAP Database.

## SAP PI/PO
SAP Process Integration / Process Orchestration (PI/PO) is used as middleware to integrate the SAP ERP Portal with the SAP Database. A seamless synchronous connection is to be made via the adapters (ABAP PROXY/ RFC/ IDOC) available. The adapters provide the end to end communication between the server and database.
## Back-end
The complete back-end have to be implemented using SAP ECC/S4 Systems via ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming). All the ABAP programs are to be saved in packages with the corresponding TR (Transport Request).
